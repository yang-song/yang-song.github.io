Most existing CMs are trained using discretized timesteps, which introduce additional hyperparameters and are prone to discretization errors. While continuous-time formulations can mitigate these issues, their success has been limited by training instability. To address this, we propose a simplified theoretical framework that unifies previous parameterizations of diffusion models and CMs, identifying the root causes of instability. Based on this analysis, we introduce key improvements in diffusion process parameterization, network architecture, and training objectives. These changes enable us to train continuous-time CMs at an unprecedented scale, reaching 1.5B parameters on ImageNet 512x512. Our proposed training algorithm, using only two sampling steps, achieves FID scores of 2.06 on CIFAR-10, 1.48 on ImageNet 64x64, and 1.88 on ImageNet 512x512, narrowing the gap in FID scores with the best existing diffusion models to within 10%.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">CVPR</abbr><span class="award badge">Oral</span> </div> <div id="zhang2024deps" class="col-sm-9"> <div class="title">Improving Diffusion Inverse Problem Solving with Decoupled Noise Annealing</div> <div class="author"> Bingliang Zhang, Wenda Chu, Julius Berner, Chenlin Meng, Anima Anandkumar, and <em>Yang Song</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2025.</em> </div> <span class="honor"> Oral Presentation [Top 3.3%] </span> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01521" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> <a href="https://github.com/zhangbingliang2019/DAPS" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code</a> <a href="https://daps-inverse-problem.github.io/" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Website</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Diffusion models have recently achieved success in solving Bayesian inverse problems with learned data priors. Current methods build on top of the diffusion sampling process, where each denoising step makes small modifications to samples from the previous step. However, this process struggles to correct errors from earlier sampling steps, leading to worse performance in complicated nonlinear inverse problems, such as phase retrieval. To address this challenge, we propose a new method called Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) that relies on a novel noise annealing process. Specifically, we decouple consecutive steps in a diffusion sampling trajectory, allowing them to vary considerably from one another while ensuring their time-marginals anneal to the true posterior as we reduce noise levels. This approach enables the exploration of a larger solution space, improving the success rate for accurate reconstructions. We demonstrate that DAPS significantly improves sample quality and stability across multiple image restoration tasks, particularly in complicated nonlinear inverse problems. For example, we achieve a PSNR of 30.72dB on the FFHQ 256 dataset for phase retrieval, which is an improvement of 9.12dB compared to existing methods.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2024</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">ICLR</abbr><span class="award badge">Oral</span> </div> <div id="song2023consistency2" class="col-sm-9"> <div class="title">Improved Techniques for Training Consistency Models</div> <div class="author"> <em>Yang Song</em>, and <a href="https://prafulladhariwal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prafulla Dhariwal</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In the 12th International Conference on Learning Representations, 2024.</em> </div> <span class="honor"> Oral Presentation [Top 1.2%] </span> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14189" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/ICLR2024/ict.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Poster</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Consistency models are a nascent family of generative models that can sample high quality data in one step without the need for adversarial training. Current consistency models achieve optimal sample quality by distilling from pre-trained diffusion models and employing learned metrics such as LPIPS. However, distillation limits the quality of consistency models to that of the pre-trained diffusion model, and LPIPS causes undesirable bias in evaluation. To tackle these challenges, we present improved techniques for consistency training, where consistency models learn directly from data without distillation. We delve into the theory behind consistency training and identify a previously overlooked flaw, which we address by eliminating Exponential Moving Average from the teacher consistency model. To replace learned metrics like LPIPS, we adopt Pseudo-Huber losses from robust statistics. Additionally, we introduce a lognormal noise schedule for the consistency training objective, and propose to double total discretization steps every set number of training iterations. Combined with better hyperparameter tuning, these modifications enable consistency models to achieve FID scores of 2.51 and 3.25 on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet 64×64 respectively in a single sampling step. These scores mark a 3.5× and 4× improvement compared to prior consistency training approaches. Through two-step sampling, we further reduce FID scores to 2.24 and 2.77 on these two datasets, surpassing those obtained via distillation in both one-step and two-step settings, while narrowing the gap between consistency models and other state-of-the-art generative models.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">ICLR</abbr></div> <div id="dou2024diffusion" class="col-sm-9"> <div class="title">Diffusion Posterior Sampling for Linear Inverse Problem Solving: A Filtering Perspective</div> <div class="author"> Zehao Dou, and <em>Yang Song</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In the 12th International Conference on Learning Representations, 2024.</em> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=tplXNcHZs1" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> <a href="https://github.com/ZehaoDou-official/FPS-SMC-2023" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Diffusion models have achieved tremendous success in generating high-dimensional data like images, videos and audio. These models provide powerful data priors that can solve linear inverse problems in zero shot through Bayesian posterior sampling. However, exact posterior sampling for diffusion models is intractable. Current solutions often hinge on approximations that are either computationally expensive or lack strong theoretical guarantees. In this work, we introduce an efficient diffusion sampling algorithm for linear inverse problems that is guaranteed to be asymptotically accurate. We reveal a link between Bayesian posterior sampling and Bayesian filtering in diffusion models, proving the former as a specific instance of the latter. Our method, termed filtering posterior sampling, leverages sequential Monte Carlo methods to solve the corresponding filtering problem. It seamlessly integrates with all Markovian diffusion samplers, requires no model re-training, and guarantees accurate samples from the Bayesian posterior as particle counts rise. Empirical tests demonstrate that our method generates better or comparable results than leading zero-shot diffusion posterior samplers on tasks like image inpainting, super-resolution, and deblurring.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2023</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">ICML</abbr></div> <div id="song2023consistency" class="col-sm-9"> <div class="title">Consistency Models</div> <div class="author"> <em>Yang Song</em>, <a href="https://prafulladhariwal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prafulla Dhariwal</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5fU-QMwAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Chen</a>, and <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~ilya/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ilya Sutskever</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In the 40th International Conference on Machine Learning, 2023.</em> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01469" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> <a href="https://github.com/openai/consistency_models" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/ICML2023/consistency.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Poster</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/12/openai-looks-beyond-diffusion-with-consistency-based-image-generator/" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Media</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Diffusion models have made significant breakthroughs in image, audio, and video generation, but they depend on an iterative generation process that causes slow sampling speed and caps their potential for real-time applications.

However, even with the power of deep neural networks, building powerful probabilistic models is non-trivial. One major challenge is the need to normalize probability distributions; that is, to ensure the total probability equals one. This necessitates summing over all possible model outputs, which quickly becomes impractical in high-dimensional spaces. In this dissertation, I propose to address this difficulty by working with data distributions through their score functions. These functions, defined as gradients of log data densities, capture information about the corresponding data distributions without requiring normalization, hence can be modeled with highly flexible deep neural networks. This dissertation is organized into three parts. In Part I, I show how to estimate the score function from a finite dataset with expressive deep neural networks and efficient statistical methods. In Part II, I discuss several ways to generate new data samples from models of score functions, building upon ideas from homotopy methods, Markov chain Monte Carlo, diffusion processes, and differential equations. The resulting score-based generative models (also known as diffusion models) achieved record-breaking generation performance for numerous data modalities, challenging the long-standing dominance of generative adversarial networks on many tasks. Importantly, the sampling procedure of score-based generative models can be flexibly controlled for solving inverse problems, demonstrated by their superior performance on multiple tasks in medical image reconstruction. In Part III, I show how to evaluate probability values accurately with models of score functions. Taken together, score-based generative models provide a flexible, powerful and versatile solution for data generation in machine learning and many other disciplines of science and engineering.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">ICLR</abbr></div> <div id="song2022solving" class="col-sm-9"> <div class="title">Solving Inverse Problems in Medical Imaging with Score-Based Generative Models </div> <div class="author"> <em>Yang Song</em>*, Liyue Shen*, <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/xinglab.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lei Xing</a>, and <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stefano Ermon</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In the 10th International Conference on Learning Representations, 2022.

Existing solutions based on machine learning typically train a model to directly map measurements to medical images, leveraging a training dataset of paired images and measurements. These measurements are typically synthesized from images using a fixed physical model of the measurement process, which hinders the generalization capability of models to unknown measurement processes. To address this issue, we propose a fully unsupervised technique for inverse problem solving, leveraging the recently introduced score-based generative models. Specifically, we first train a score-based generative model on medical images to capture their prior distribution. Given measurements and a physical model of the measurement process at test time, we introduce a sampling method to reconstruct an image consistent with both the prior and the observed measurements. Our method does not assume a fixed measurement process during training, and can thus be flexibly adapted to different measurement processes at test time. Empirically, we observe comparable or better performance to supervised learning techniques in several medical imaging tasks in CT and MRI, while demonstrating significantly better generalization to unknown measurement processes. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">ICLR</abbr></div> <div id="meng2022sdedit" class="col-sm-9"> <div class="title">SDEdit: Guided Image Synthesis and Editing with Stochastic Differential Equations</div> <div class="author"> Chenlin Meng, Yutong He, <em>Yang Song</em>, Jiaming Song, <a href="https://jiajunwu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jiajun Wu</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~junyanz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jun-Yan Zhu</a>, and <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stefano Ermon</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In the 10th International Conference on Learning Representations, 2022.</em> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01073" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> <a href="https://github.com/ermongroup/SDEdit" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code</a> <a href="https://chenlin9.github.io/SDEdit/" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Website</a> <a href="https://www.louisbouchard.ai/image-synthesis-from-sketches/" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Media</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>We introduce a new image editing and synthesis framework, Stochastic Differential Editing (SDEdit), based on a recent generative model using stochastic differential equations (SDEs).

Recently, significant progress has been achieved with machine learning approaches, especially with deep generative models. Inspired by the diffusion process in classical non-equilibrium thermodynamics where heated particles will diffuse from original states to a noise distribution, in this paper, we propose a novel generative model named GeoDiff for molecular conformation prediction. GeoDiff treats each atom as a particle and learns to directly reverse the diffusion process (i.e., transforming from a noise distribution to stable conformations) as a Markov chain. Modeling such a generation process is however very challenging as the likelihood of conformations should be roto-translational invariant. We theoretically show that Markov chains evolving with equivariant Markov kernels can induce an invariant distribution by design, and further propose building blocks for the Markov kernels to preserve the desirable equivariance property. The whole framework can be efficiently trained in an end-to-end fashion by optimizing a weighted variational lower bound to the (conditional) likelihood. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that GeoDiff is superior or comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches, especially on large molecules. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">AISTATS</abbr><span class="award badge">Oral</span> </div> <div id="kristy2022density" class="col-sm-9"> <div class="title">Density Ratio Estimation via Infinitesimal Classification</div> <div class="author"> Kristy Choi, Chenlin Meng, <em>Yang Song</em>, and <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stefano Ermon</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In the 25th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, 2022.</em> </div> <span class="honor"> Oral Presentation [Top 2.6%] </span> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11010" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> <a href="https://github.com/ermongroup/dre-infinity" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p> Density ratio estimation (DRE) is a fundamental machine learning technique for comparing two probability distributions. However, existing methods struggle in high-dimensional settings, as it is difficult to accurately compare probability distributions based on finite samples. In this work we propose DRE-∞, a divide-and-conquer approach to reduce DRE to a series of easier subproblems. Inspired by Monte Carlo methods, we smoothly interpolate between the two distributions via an infinite continuum of intermediate bridge distributions. We then estimate the instantaneous rate of change of the bridge distributions indexed by time (the "time score") – a quantity defined analogously to data (Stein) scores – with a novel time score matching objective. Crucially, the learned time scores can then be integrated to compute the desired density ratio. In addition, we show that traditional (Stein) scores can be used to obtain integration paths that connect regions of high density in both distributions, improving performance in practice.

Generative models have been used as adversarially robust classifiers on simple datasets such as MNIST, but this robustness has not been observed on more complex datasets like CIFAR-10. Additionally, on natural image datasets, previous results have suggested a trade-off between the likelihood of the data and classification accuracy. In this work, we investigate score-based generative models as classifiers for natural images. We show that these models not only obtain competitive likelihood values but simultaneously achieve state-of-the-art classification accuracy for generative classifiers on CIFAR-10. Nevertheless, we find that these models are only slightly, if at all, more robust than discriminative baseline models on out-of-distribution tasks based on common image corruptions. Similarly and contrary to prior results, we find that score-based are prone to worst-case distribution shifts in the form of adversarial perturbations. Our work highlights that score-based generative models are closing the gap in classification accuracy compared to standard discriminative models. While they do not yet deliver on the promise of adversarial and out-of-domain robustness, they provide a different approach to classification that warrants further research. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">NeurIPS</abbr><span class="award badge">Spotlight</span> </div> <div id="song2021mle" class="col-sm-9"> <div class="title">Maximum Likelihood Training of Score-Based Diffusion Models</div> <div class="author"> <em>Yang Song</em>*, Conor Durkan*, <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/imurray2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Iain Murray</a>, and <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stefano Ermon</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In the 35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, 2021.</em> </div> <span class="honor"> Spotlight Presentation [top 3%] </span> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09258" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> <a href="https://github.com/yang-song/score_flow" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/NeurIPS2021/score_flow.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Poster</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p> Score-based diffusion models synthesize samples by reversing a stochastic process that diffuses data to noise, and are trained by minimizing a weighted combination of score matching losses. The log-likelihood of score-based diffusion models can be tractably computed through a connection to continuous normalizing flows, but log-likelihood is not directly optimized by the weighted combination of score matching losses. We show that for a specific weighting scheme, the objective upper bounds the negative log-likelihood, thus enabling approximate maximum likelihood training of score-based diffusion models. We empirically observe that maximum likelihood training consistently improves the likelihood of score-based diffusion models across multiple datasets, stochastic processes, and model architectures. Our best models achieve negative log-likelihoods of 2.83 and 3.76 bits/dim on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet 32x32 without any data augmentation, on a par with state-of-the-art autoregressive models on these tasks. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">NeurIPS</abbr></div> <div id="meng2021estimating" class="col-sm-9"> <div class="title">Estimating High Order Gradients of the Data Distribution by Denoising</div> <div class="author"> Chenlin Meng, <em>Yang Song</em>, Wenzhe Li, and <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stefano Ermon</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In the 35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, 2021.</em> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04726" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> <a href="https://github.com/chenlin9/high_order_dsm" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p> The first order derivative of a data density can be estimated efficiently by denoising score matching, and has become an important component in many applications, such as image generation and audio synthesis. Higher order derivatives provide additional local information about the data distribution and enable new applications. Although they can be estimated via automatic differentiation of a learned density model, this can amplify estimation errors and is expensive in high dimensional settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a method to directly estimate high order derivatives (scores) of a data density from samples. We first show that denoising score matching can be interpreted as a particular case of Tweedie’s formula. By leveraging Tweedie’s formula on higher order moments, we generalize denoising score matching to estimate higher order derivatives. We demonstrate empirically that models trained with the proposed method can approximate second order derivatives more efficiently and accurately than via automatic differentiation. We show that our models can be used to quantify uncertainty in denoising and to improve the mixing speed of Langevin dynamics via Ozaki discretization for sampling synthetic data and natural images. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">NeurIPS</abbr></div> <div id="yu2021pseudo" class="col-sm-9"> <div class="title">Pseudo-Spherical Contrastive Divergence</div> <div class="author"> Lantao Yu, Jiaming Song, <em>Yang Song</em>, and <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stefano Ermon</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In the 35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, 2021.</em> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=8qa6hkGYDJk" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Energy-based models (EBMs) offer flexible distribution parametrization.

In this paper, we propose pseudo-spherical contrastive divergence (PS-CD) to generalize maximum likelihood learning of EBMs. PS-CD is derived from the maximization of a family of strictly proper homogeneous scoring rules, which avoids the computation of the intractable partition function and provides a generalized family of learning objectives that include contrastive divergence as a special case. Moreover, PS-CD allows us to flexibly choose various learning objectives to train EBMs without additional computational cost or variational minimax optimization. Theoretical analysis on the proposed method and experiments on both synthetic data and commonly used image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PS-CD and its superiority over maximum likelihood and -EBMs. Based on a set of recently proposed indicative generative model evaluation metrics, we also provide an analysis on the modeling tradeoffs of different objectives in the PS-CD family on image generation tasks, justifying its modeling flexibility. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">NeurIPS</abbr></div> <div id="kim2020imitation" class="col-sm-9"> <div class="title">Imitation with Neural Density Models</div> <div class="author"> Kuno Kim, Akshat Jindal, <em>Yang Song</em>, Jiaming Song, Yanan Sui, and <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stefano Ermon</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In the 35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, 2021.</em> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09808" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>We propose a new framework for Imitation Learning (IL) via density estimation of the expert’s occupancy measure followed by Maximum Occupancy Entropy Reinforcement Learning (RL) using the density as a reward.

While autoregressive models are natural candidates for time series imputation, score-based diffusion models have recently outperformed existing counterparts including autoregressive models in many tasks such as image generation and audio synthesis, and would be promising for time series imputation. In this paper, we propose Conditional Score-based Diffusion models for Imputation (CSDI), a novel time series imputation method that utilizes score-based diffusion models conditioned on observed data. Unlike existing score-based approaches, the conditional diffusion model is explicitly trained for imputation and can exploit correlations between observed values. On healthcare and environmental data, CSDI improves by 40-70% over existing probabilistic imputation methods on popular performance metrics. In addition, deterministic imputation by CSDI reduces the error by 5-20% compared to the state-of-the-art deterministic imputation methods. Furthermore, CSDI can also be applied to time series interpolation and probabilistic forecasting, and is competitive with existing baselines. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">ICML</abbr></div> <div id="song2021nonlinear" class="col-sm-9"> <div class="title">Accelerating Feedforward Computation via Parallel Nonlinear Equation Solving</div> <div class="author"> <em>Yang Song</em>, Chenlin Meng, <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rjliao/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Renjie Liao</a>, and <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stefano Ermon</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In the 38th International Conference on Machine Learning, 2021.</em> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03629" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> <a href="https://github.com/ermongroup/fast_feedforward_computation" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/ICML2021/fast_sampling.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Poster</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p> Feedforward computation, such as evaluating a neural network or sampling from an autoregressive model, is ubiquitous in machine learning. The sequential nature of feedforward computation, however, requires a strict order of execution and cannot be easily accelerated with parallel computing. To enable parallelization, we frame the task of feedforward computation as solving a system of nonlinear equations. We then propose to find the solution using a Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel fixed-point iteration method, as well as hybrid methods of both. Crucially, Jacobi updates operate independently on each equation and can be executed in parallel. Our method is guaranteed to give exactly the same values as the original feedforward computation with a reduced (or equal) number of parallel iterations, and hence reduced time given sufficient parallel computing power. Experimentally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accelerating (i) backpropagation of RNNs; (ii) evaluation of DenseNets; and (iii) autoregressive sampling of MADE and PixelCNN++, with speedup factors between 1.12 and 33 under various settings. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Book Chapter</abbr></div> <div id="song2021how" class="col-sm-9"> <div class="title">How to Train Your Energy-Based Models</div> <div class="author"> <em>Yang Song</em>, and <a href="http://dpkingma.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diederik P.

However, the unknown normalizing constant of EBMs makes training particularly difficult. Our goal is to provide a friendly introduction to modern approaches for EBM training. We start by explaining maximum likelihood training with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and proceed to elaborate on MCMC-free approaches, including Score Matching (SM) and Noise Constrastive Estimation (NCE).

We present a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that smoothly transforms a complex data distribution to a known prior distribution by slowly injecting noise, and a corresponding reverse-time SDE that transforms the prior distribution back into the data distribution by slowly removing the noise. Crucially, the reverse-time SDE depends only on the time-dependent gradient field (a.k.a., score) of the perturbed data distribution. By leveraging advances in score-based generative modeling, we can accurately estimate these scores with neural networks, and use numerical SDE solvers to generate samples. We show that this framework encapsulates previous approaches in score-based generative modeling and diffusion probabilistic modeling, allowing for new sampling procedures and new modeling capabilities. In particular, we introduce a predictor-corrector framework to correct errors in the evolution of the discretized reverse-time SDE. We also derive an equivalent neural ODE that samples from the same distribution as the SDE, but additionally enables exact likelihood computation, and improved sampling efficiency. In addition, we provide a new way to solve inverse problems with score-based models, as demonstrated with experiments on class-conditional generation, image inpainting, and colorization. Combined with multiple architectural improvements, we achieve record-breaking performance for unconditional image generation on CIFAR-10 with an Inception score of 9.89 and FID of 2.20, a competitive likelihood of 2.99 bits/dim, and demonstrate high fidelity generation of 1024 x 1024 images for the first time from a score-based generative model. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">ICLR</abbr><span class="award badge">Oral</span> </div> <div id="meng2021improved" class="col-sm-9"> <div class="title">Improved Autoregressive Modeling with Distribution Smoothing</div> <div class="author"> Chenlin Meng, Jiaming Song, <em>Yang Song</em>, Shengjia Zhao, and <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stefano Ermon</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In the 9th International Conference on Learning Representations, 2021.</em> </div> <span class="honor"> Oral Presentation [top 1.8%] </span> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJA5Pz7lHKb" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> <a href="https://github.com/chenlin9/Autoregressive-Modeling-with-Distribution-Smoothing" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p> While autoregressive models excel at image compression, their sample quality is often lacking.

Inspired by recent progress on diffusion probabilistic models, we present a diffusion recovery likelihood method to tractably learn and sample from a sequence of EBMs trained on increasingly noisy versions of a dataset. Each EBM is trained by maximizing the recovery likelihood: the conditional probability of the data at a certain noise level given their noisy versions at a higher noise level. The recovery likelihood objective is more tractable than the marginal likelihood objective, since it only requires MCMC sampling from a relatively concentrated conditional distribution. Moreover, we show that this estimation method is theoretically consistent: it learns the correct conditional and marginal distributions at each noise level, given sufficient data. After training, synthesized images can be generated efficiently by a sampling process that initializes from a spherical Gaussian distribution and progressively samples the conditional distributions at decreasingly lower noise levels. Our method generates high fidelity samples on various image datasets. On unconditional CIFAR-10 our method achieves FID 9.60 and inception score 8.58, superior to the majority of GANs. Moreover, we demonstrate that unlike previous work on EBMs, our long-run MCMC samples from the conditional distributions do not diverge and still represent realistic images, allowing us to accurately estimate the normalized density of data even for high-dimensional datasets. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">ICLR</abbr></div> <div id="gao2020learninh" class="col-sm-9"> <div class="title">Anytime Sampling for Autoregressive Models via Ordered Autoencoding</div> <div class="author"> Yilun Xu, <em>Yang Song</em>, Sahaj Garg, Linyuan Gong, Rui Shu, <a href="https://aditya-grover.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aditya Grover</a>, and <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stefano Ermon</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In the 9th International Conference on Learning Representations, 2021.</em> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=TSRTzJnuEBS" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> <a href="https://github.com/Newbeeer/Anytime-Auto-Regressive-Model" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p> Autoregressive models are widely used for tasks such as image and audio generation. The sampling process of these models, however, does not allow interruptions and cannot adapt to real-time computational resources. This challenge impedes the deployment of powerful autoregressive models, which involve a slow sampling process that is sequential in nature and typically scales linearly with respect to the data dimension. To address this difficulty, we propose a new family of autoregressive models that enables anytime sampling. Inspired by Principal Component Analysis, we learn a structured representation space where dimensions are ordered based on their importance with respect to reconstruction. Using an autoregressive model in this latent space, we trade off sample quality for computational efficiency by truncating the generation process before decoding into the original data space. Experimentally, we demonstrate in several image and audio generation tasks that sample quality degrades gracefully as we reduce the computational budget for sampling. The approach suffers almost no loss in sample quality (measured by FID) using only 60% to 80% of all latent dimensions for image data. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2020</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">NeurIPS</abbr></div> <div id="song2020improved" class="col-sm-9"> <div class="title">Improved Techniques for Training Score-Based Generative Models</div> <div class="author"> <em>Yang Song</em>, and <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stefano Ermon</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In the 34th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, 2020.</em> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09011" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> <a href="https://yang-song.github.io/blog/2021/score/" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blog</a> <a href="https://github.com/ermongroup/ncsnv2" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/NeurIPS2020/ncsnv2-poster.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Poster</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p> Score-based generative models can produce high quality image samples comparable to GANs, without requiring adversarial optimization.

These simple perturbations, however, could be suboptimal as they are agnostic to the model being attacked. To improve the efficiency of these attacks, we propose Output Diversified Sampling (ODS), a novel sampling strategy that attempts to maximize diversity in the target model’s outputs among the generated samples. While ODS is a gradient-based strategy, the diversity offered by ODS is transferable and can be helpful for both white-box and black-box attacks via surrogate models. Empirically, we demonstrate that ODS significantly improves the performance of existing white-box and black-box attacks. In particular, ODS reduces the number of queries needed for state-of-the-art black-box attacks on ImageNet by a factor of two. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">NeurIPS</abbr></div> <div id="meng2020autoregressive" class="col-sm-9"> <div class="title">Autoregressive Score Matching</div> <div class="author"> Chenlin Meng, Lantao Yu, <em>Yang Song</em>, Jiaming Song, and <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stefano Ermon</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In the 34th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, 2020.</em> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12810" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p> Autoregressive models use the chain rule to define a joint probability distribution as a product of conditionals.

To train AR-CSM, we introduce a new divergence between distributions named Composite Score Matching (CSM).

However, most of the existing generative models for graphs are not invariant to the chosen ordering, which might lead to an undesirable bias in the learned distribution. To address this difficulty, we propose a permutation invariant approach to modeling graphs, using the recent framework of score-based generative modeling. In particular, we design a permutation equivariant, multi-channel graph neural network to model the gradient of the data distribution at the input graph (a.k.a., the score function). This permutation equivariant model of gradients implicitly defines a permutation invariant distribution for graphs. We train this graph neural network with score matching and sample from it with annealed Langevin dynamics. In our experiments, we first demonstrate the capacity of this new architecture in learning discrete graph algorithms. For graph generation, we find that our learning approach achieves better or comparable results to existing models on benchmark datasets. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2019</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">arXiv</abbr></div> <div id="song2019unsupervised" class="col-sm-9"> <div class="title">Unsupervised Out-of-Distribution Detection with Batch Normalization</div> <div class="author"> Jiaming Song, <em>Yang Song</em>, and <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stefano Ermon</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Technical report (10/21/2019).</em> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09115" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p> Likelihood from a generative model is a natural statistic for detecting out-of-distribution (OoD) samples.

To address these issues, we propose a new method that leverages batch normalization. We argue that batch normalization for generative models challenges the traditional i.i.d. data assumption and changes the corresponding maximum likelihood objective.

However, existing certified defense strategies only safeguard against perturbation-based adversarial attacks, where the attacker is only allowed to modify normal data points by adding small perturbations. In this paper, we provide certified defenses under the more general threat model of unrestricted adversarial attacks. We allow the attacker to generate arbitrary inputs to fool the classifier, and assume the attacker knows everything except the classifiers’ parameters and the training dataset used to learn it. Lack of knowledge about the classifiers parameters prevents an attacker from generating adversarial examples successfully. Our defense draws inspiration from differential privacy, and is based on intentionally adding noise to the classifier’s outputs to limit the attacker’s knowledge about the parameters. We prove concrete bounds on the minimum number of queries required for any attacker to generate a successful adversarial attack. For a simple linear classifiers we prove that the bound is asymptotically optimal up to a constant by exhibiting an attack algorithm that achieves this lower bound. We empirically show the success of our defense strategy against strong black box attack algorithms. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">NeurIPS</abbr><span class="award badge">Oral</span> </div> <div id="song2019generative" class="col-sm-9"> <div class="title">Generative Modeling by Estimating Gradients of the Data Distribution</div> <div class="author"> <em>Yang Song</em>, and <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stefano Ermon</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In the 33rd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, 2019.</em> </div> <span class="honor"> Oral Presentation [top 0.5%] </span> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05600" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> <a href="https://yang-song.github.io/blog/2021/score/" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blog</a> <a href="https://github.com/ermongroup/ncsn" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/NeurIPS2019/ncsn-poster.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Poster</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/NeurIPS2019/talk_public.pptx" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Slides</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oc3X_x1Q1jU" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Media</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p> We introduce a new generative model where samples are produced via Langevin dynamics using gradients of the data distribution estimated with score matching.

Different from perturbation-based attacks, we propose to synthesize unrestricted adversarial examples entirely from scratch using conditional generative models. Specifically, we first train an Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (AC-GAN) to model the class-conditional distribution over data samples. Then, conditioned on a desired class, we search over the AC-GAN latent space to find images that are likely under the generative model and are misclassified by a target classifier.

We propose to use higher-order integrators and geodesic corrections to obtain more invariant optimization trajectories. We prove the numerical convergence properties of geodesic corrected updates and show that they can be as computational efficient as plain natural gradient. Experimentally, we demonstrate that invariance leads to faster optimization and our techniques improve on traditional natural gradient in deep neural network training and natural policy gradient for reinforcement learning. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">ICLR</abbr></div> <div id="song2018pixeldefend" class="col-sm-9"> <div class="title"> PixelDefend: Leveraging Generative Models to Understand and Defend against Adversarial Examples </div> <div class="author"> <em>Yang Song</em>, Taesup Kim, <a href="http://www.nowozin.net/sebastian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sebastian Nowozin</a>, <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stefano Ermon</a>, and <a href="http://www.kushman.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nate Kushman</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In the 6th International Conference on Learning Representations, 2018. </em> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10766" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/PixelDefend/" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/ICLR2018/pixeldefend-poster.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Poster</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p> Adversarial perturbations of normal images are usually imperceptible to humans, but they can seriously confuse state-of-the-art machine learning models. What makes them so special in the eyes of image classifiers? In this paper, we show empirically that adversarial examples mainly lie in the low probability regions of the training distribution, regardless of attack types and targeted models. Using statistical hypothesis testing, we find that modern neural density models are surprisingly good at detecting imperceptible image perturbations. Based on this discovery, we devised PixelDefend, a new approach that purifies a maliciously perturbed image by moving it back towards the distribution seen in the training data. The purified image is then run through an unmodified classifier, making our method agnostic to both the classifier and the attacking method. As a result, PixelDefend can be used to protect already deployed models and be combined with other model-specific defenses. Experiments show that our method greatly improves resilience across a wide variety of state-of-the-art attacking methods, increasing accuracy on the strongest attack from 63% to 84% for Fashion MNIST and from 32% to 70% for CIFAR-10. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2016</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">NeurIPS</abbr></div> <div id="song2016kernel" class="col-sm-9"> <div class="title"> Kernel Bayesian Inference with Posterior Regularization </div> <div class="author"> <em>Yang Song</em>, <a href="http://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jun Zhu</a>, and Yong Ren </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In the 30th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, 2016. </em> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02011" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/NIPS2016/kRegBayes_poster.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Poster</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p> We propose a vector-valued regression problem whose solution is equivalent to the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) embedding of the Bayesian posterior distribution. This equivalence provides a new understanding of kernel Bayesian inference. Moreover, the optimization problem induces a new regularization for the posterior embedding estimator, which is faster and has comparable performance to the squared regularization in kernel Bayes’ rule. This regularization coincides with a former thresholding approach used in kernel POMDPs whose consistency remains to be established. Our theoretical work solves this open problem and provides consistency analysis in regression settings. Based on our optimizational formulation, we propose a flexible Bayesian posterior regularization framework which for the first time enables us to put regularization at the distribution level. We apply this method to nonparametric state-space filtering tasks with extremely nonlinear dynamics and show performance gains over all other baselines. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">NeurIPS</abbr></div> <div id="liu2016stochastic" class="col-sm-9"> <div class="title"> Stochastic Gradient Geodesic MCMC Methods </div> <div class="author"> Chang Liu, <a href="http://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jun Zhu</a>, and <em>Yang Song</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In the 30th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, 2016. </em> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6282-stochastic-gradient-geodesic-mcmc-methods" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> <a href="http://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~changliu/sggmcmc-sam/" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p> We propose two stochastic gradient MCMC methods for sampling from Bayesian posterior distributions defined on Riemann manifolds with a known geodesic flow, e.g. hyperspheres. Our methods are the first scalable sampling methods on these manifolds, with the aid of stochastic gradients. Novel dynamics are conceived and second-order integrators are developed. By adopting embedding techniques and the geodesic integrator, the methods do not require a global coordinate system of the manifold and do not involve inner iterations. Synthetic experiments show the validity of the method, and its application to the challenging inference for spherical topic models indicate practical usability and efficiency. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">ICML</abbr></div> <div id="song2016training" class="col-sm-9"> <div class="title">Training Deep Neural Networks via Direct Loss Minimization</div> <div class="author"> <em>Yang Song</em>, <a href="http://www.alexander-schwing.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexander Schwing</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~zemel/inquiry/home.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Richard Zemel</a>, and <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~urtasun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raquel Urtasun</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In the 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning, 2016.</em> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06411" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/ICML2016/supplementary_materials.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Supp</a> <a href="https://github.com/yang-song/APDLM" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p> Supervised training of deep neural nets typically relies on minimizing cross-entropy. However, in many domains, we are interested in performing well on metrics specific to the application. In this paper we propose a direct loss minimization approach to train deep neural networks, which provably minimizes the application-specific loss function. This is often non-trivial, since these functions are neither smooth nor decomposable and thus are not amenable to optimization with standard gradient-based methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the context of maximizing average precision for ranking problems. Towards this goal, we develop a novel dynamic programming algorithm that can efficiently compute the weight updates. Our approach proves superior to a variety of baselines in the context of action classification and object detection, especially in the presence of label noise. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge">AAAI</abbr><span class="award badge">Oral</span> </div> <div id="song2016bayesian" class="col-sm-9"> <div class="title">Bayesian Matrix Completion via Adaptive Relaxed Spectral Regularization</div> <div class="author"> <em>Yang Song</em>, and <a href="http://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jun Zhu</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In the 30th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2016.</em> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01110" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/AAAI2016/GASR-supp.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Supp</a> <a href="https://github.com/yang-song/GASR" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/AAAI2016/gasr_slides.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Slides</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p> Bayesian matrix completion has been studied based on a low-rank matrix factorization formulation with promising results. However, little work has been done on Bayesian matrix completion based on the more direct spectral regularization formulation. We fill this gap by presenting a novel Bayesian matrix completion method based on spectral regularization. In order to circumvent the difficulties of dealing with the orthonormality constraints of singular vectors, we derive a new equivalent form with relaxed constraints, which then leads us to design an adaptive version of spectral regularization feasible for Bayesian inference. Our Bayesian method requires no parameter tuning and can infer the number of latent factors automatically. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate encouraging results on rank recovery and collaborative filtering, with notably good results for very sparse matrices. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Yang Song.
