I am a full-time AI researcher at [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/) advised by [Qi Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LVO1_ZsAAAAJ&hl=en), [Hadi Kharrazi](http://hkharrazi.com/), and [David C. Fajgenbaum](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8205911). I am currently working closely with [Yuzhe Yang](https://people.csail.mit.edu/yuzhe/) and [Ying Nian Wu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~ywu/) as well. My recent research interests are in AI agents in Healthcare and Foundation model in Pharmacology.

Before joining the FDA, I earned an M.Eng. in Artificial Intelligence from the [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu/), and a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Quantitative Economics at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/). I was also fortunate to be advised by [Amir M. Rahmani](https://ics.uci.edu/~amirr1/) at the [UCI HealthSciTech Group](https://healthscitech.nursing.uci.edu/), and [Guang Cheng](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~guangcheng/2.html) at UCLA, where I researched synthetic data through deep generative modeling.

If you are a student interested in research about AI for health or would like to collaborate, please email me!
